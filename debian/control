Description: Frameworks for simulation and calibration of radio interferometers
 MeqTrees is a software package for implementing Measurement Equations. This
 makes it uniquely suited for simulation and calibration of radioastronomical
 data, especially that involving new radiotelescopes and observational
 regimes.
 .
 The Cattery is a set of MeqTrees-based frameworks for simulation and
 calibration of radio interferometers. Pretty much everything is done via a
 Cattery package these days.
